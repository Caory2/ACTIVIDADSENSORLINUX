.TH ASSIGNMENT-SENSOR 1 "October 2025" "assignment-sensor" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
assignment-sensor \- sample a simulated sensor and log ISO-8601 timestamped values
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR assignment-sensor " [--interval <seconds>] [--logfile <path>] [--device <path>]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBassignment-sensor\fR program samples 8 bytes from a device (by default \fI/dev/urandom\fR) at a configurable interval and appends lines to a logfile.

Each line has the form:
.PP
2025-10-03T04:55:10.372784951Z | 0xd8482ad47017050a
.PP
Timestamp is RFC3339 (UTC) with nanoseconds. Value is an 8-byte hex value.

The program attempts to open the primary logfile; if that fails it falls back to /var/tmp/assignment_sensor.log.

On SIGINT or SIGTERM the program flushes and closes the logfile and exits cleanly (exit code 0).
